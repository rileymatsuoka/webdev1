    <p style="color:blue">Hi, I’m Peter Parker, but you probably know me better as Spider-Man. My life was pretty normal until one fateful day when I was bitten by a radioactive spider during a school field trip. That bite gave me incredible powers—super strength, the ability to stick to walls, and heightened senses. But with great power comes great responsibility, something I learned the hard way when my Uncle Ben was tragically taken from me. Now, I balance my life as a regular college student with being New York City's friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. I fight to protect my city from villains, all while juggling school, work, and the people I love. Every day is a new challenge, but I keep swinging because it’s not just about saving the day—it’s about making sure the people I care about are safe and never giving up, no matter what.</p>
